# BachelorProject
This repository contains the code and results of the experiments described in Equipping Braitenberg Vehicles with Lights and its Effect on the Evolutionary Dynamics of Braitenbergâ€™s Experiment Six. The code was taken from H. de Weerd (http:/www.harmendeweerd.nl/braitenberg-vehicles/ ) and altered by Sanne Berends. experiment.html can be used to run the experiment. 

Within the results folder, the results of all three sub-experiments can be found. These sub-folders also contain a video that shows an example run.
